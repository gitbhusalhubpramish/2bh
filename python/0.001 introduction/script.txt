"So, Python? Ohh… not again.
Wait—yeah, this one.
You clicked this video to learn Python, right? Then welcome to our fresh Python course by 2bh! Let’s kick things off with a proper introduction to Python."

[Introduction to Python]
"Whether you're just starting your coding journey or planning to build real-world projects, Python is the perfect language to begin with.
It’s a high-level, interpreted, flexible, and beginner-friendly programming language used in fields like:

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

- Game Development

- Web Development

- Data Science, and much more.

Python is loved by beginners for its simple syntax and by professionals for its huge community and powerful libraries.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and released on February 20, 1991. 
And yes — since it’s a high-level, interpreted language, it runs slower than low-level languages like C or C++. But that’s not a deal-breaker

[The Big Question: Why Python if it's Slow?]
Now you might be thinking — "If Python is so slow, why even use it?"
Well, here's why:

Despite being slower, Python makes development faster and easier because of:

- Easy-to-read, clean syntax

- Tons of libraries for almost anything

A massive collection of libraries like:

- Pygame – for game dev

- Docker – for building and deploying

- Django & Flask – for web apps

- NumPy & Pandas – for data analysis

- TensorFlow & PyTorch – for training machine learning models
So yeah, it’s slow… but it saves you hours of coding.

[Why Python Over Other Languages?]
"There are so many programming languages out there — C, C++, Java, JavaScript, even Assembly.

But Python? It’s the king of simplicity.

What takes 6 lines in C++, takes 1 line in Python — and the result is the same.
Sure, Python is a bit slower, but for most projects, that tradeoff is totally worth it.
